			<h2>What to Expect</h2>
			<p>The co-op program is open to all students provided they meet <a href='eligibility.html'>a few general requirements</a>. The program offers many <a href="examples.html">amazing opportunities</a>, but it isn't for everyone. Students in the co-op program extend their degree from 4 to 5 years, as they spend several semesters not studying. Additionally, <a href='scheduling.html'>the schedule</a> will take up time during some summers to make up for missed semesters.</p>
