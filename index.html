				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The Cooperative Education Program, or co-op for short, allows students to get valuable work experience throughout their time at Stevens. These are always paid, professional jobs, where students will be applying their knowledge, not just getting coffee. The program is open to students studying an engineering or science discipline. </p>
				<p>Members of the co-op program will spend several semesters working instead of attending Stevens. During this time, they do not pay tuition. Instead, they are making money while getting work experience.</p>

				<h2>What to Expect</h2>
				<p>The co-op program is open to all students provided they meet <a href='eligibility.html'>a few general requirements</a>. The program offers many <a href="examples.html">amazing opportunities</a>, but it isn't for everyone. Students in the co-op program extend their degree from 4 to 5 years, as they spend several semesters not studying. Additionally, <a href='scheduling.html'>the schedule</a> will take up time during some summers to make up for missed semesters.</p>
